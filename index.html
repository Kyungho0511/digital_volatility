            The impact of viral social media trends on the urban alleyways

            Much of Seoul has grown organically without centralized planning,
            resulting in a flexible urban fabric dominated by low rise,
            high-density residential blocks called villas. When these villas
            alleyways align with urban attractions, their adjacent alleys often
            transform into trendy hubs for young entrepreneurs, gaining
            popularity on Instagram. However, the viral trends in social media
            made its popularity very unpredictable.

          <p>
            Social media, particularly Instagram, has played a pivotal role in
            the commercial development of Gyeonglidan-gil. Gyeonglidan-gil is
            the typical example that suffered from the viral trends of social
            media, sudden downfall in social media trends with gentrification
            almost led the entire alleyway out of business.

          <h1>Analyze the popularity of alleys</h1>
          <img
            src="./images/feedback_loops2.png"

          />
          <p>
            I examined the popularity of urban alleyways using various factors,
            including social media trends in Gyeonglidan-gil, land prices, and
            proximity to attractions and subway stations. My initial hypothesis
            suggests that the volatility of social media trends may have a
            negative impact on the longevity of commercial alleyways. As a
            location gains exponential popularity on social media platforms, an
            influx of people competes for space in the alleyways, leading to
            gentrification. Consequently, as service prices rise due to
            gentrification, the reputation of the area diminishes exponentially
            on social media.
